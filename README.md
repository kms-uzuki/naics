# CEUS Scripts 
simple optimization scripts for internship.
these scripts are tailored to run for certain documents that you specify either in the code itself or at a shell; as such, they should only be run within the CEC.

As a prerequisite, the [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ "openpyxl Documentation") library should be installed. 

for any clarifications or issues, please contact me at kensuzki17@gmail.com .
